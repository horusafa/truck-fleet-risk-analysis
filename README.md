## Project Description

The Truck Fleet Risk Analysis project uses advanced data analytics techniques to assess the safety of truck fleets. We analyze various data points, including driving behavior, weather conditions, and traffic patterns. The insights generated can help fleet managers make informed decisions to enhance safety protocols.

## Technologies Used

- **Big Data**: Hadoop, HDFS
- **Data Analytics**: HiveQL, SAS, Statistical Analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Predictive Modeling
- **Geographic Analysis**: GIS Tools

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and set up your environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/horusafa/truck-fleet-risk-analysis.git
cd truck-fleet-risk-analysis
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java (for Hadoop)
- Python (for data processing)
- R (for statistical analysis)
- Tableau (for visualization)

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the necessary packages:

1. **Install Hadoop**: Follow the [Hadoop installation guide](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html).
2. **Set up Hive**: Refer to the [Hive setup documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home).
3. **Install Python Libraries**: Use pip to install required libraries.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

4. **Install R Packages**: Use the following commands in R.

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from multiple sources:

- **Fleet Management Systems**: Data on vehicle performance and driver behavior.
- **Traffic Data**: Publicly available traffic data from government databases.
- **Weather Data**: Historical weather data from meteorological services.

## How to Use

To analyze the data, follow these steps:

1. Load the data into HDFS.
2. Use HiveQL to query the data and extract insights.
3. Apply machine learning algorithms to predict risk factors.
4. Visualize the results using Tableau.

For detailed instructions, refer to the `docs` folder in the repository.

## Key Features

- **Risk Factor Identification**: Understand the key factors contributing to accidents.
- **Driving Pattern Analysis**: Analyze patterns to improve driver training.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict potential risks.
- **Geographic Insights**: Visualize data geographically to identify high-risk areas.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the data. We use Tableau to create interactive dashboards that display:

- Accident hotspots
- Driver behavior patterns
- Weather impact on driving safety
