- Rank drivers by risk factors and violation patterns

### 2. **Geographical Analysis** 
- Evaluate relative risk levels of California's riskiest cities
- Compare regional risk patterns to determine high-risk zones

### 3. **Truck Model Analysis**
- Evaluate and compare truck models using average risk factors and event counts
- Identify safest and most dangerous vehicle models

### 4. **Driving Incident Analysis**
- Analyze factors related to driving events and violations
- Identify patterns in incident types and locations

### 5. **Mileage/Speed Analysis**
- Categorize drivers into high and low-risk groups
- Analyze relationships between total miles, maximum speed, and average mileage

### 6. **Predictive Modeling**
- Develop linear regression models to predict driver risk factors
- Identify significant variables influencing driver safety

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🚨 Driver Risk Analysis
- **Highest Risk Driver**: Driver A97 with risk factor of 31.69
- **Most Common Violation**: Lane departure (committed by almost all risky drivers)
- **Critical Insight**: Personalized training needed based on individual violation patterns

### 🗺️ Geographical Risk Assessment
- **Highest Risk City**: Santa Rosa, CA (53 violations)
- **Second Highest**: Willits, CA (28 violations)
- **Regional Pattern**: Most violations concentrated in northwestern California
- **Risk Distribution**: Clear geographic clustering of high-risk areas

### 🚚 Truck Model Performance
- **Highest Risk Model**: Oshkosh (average risk factor: 10.45)
- **Lowest Risk Model**: Navistar (average risk factor: 5.862)
- **Most Violations**: Ford model involved in bulk of infractions
- **Best Performer**: Crane model with extremely few infractions

### 🚦 Driving Incident Breakdown
**Santa Rosa (Highest Risk City) Incidents:**
- Lane Departure: 15 incidents
- Overspeed: 11 incidents  
- Unsafe Following Distance: 15 incidents
- Unsafe Tail Distance: 12 incidents

**Overall Incident Distribution:**
- Lane Departures: 33.33% of incidents
- Unsafe Following Distances: 32.80% of incidents

**Top 5 High-Risk Drivers**: A35, A43, A92, A94, A11

### 📊 Mileage/Speed Risk Correlation
**High-Risk Driver Patterns:**
- **Total Miles**: 620,000 - 680,000 miles
- **Maximum Speed**: 70 - 95 mph
- **Average Mileage**: 4.5 - 6.0 MPG

**Important Note**: Many low-risk drivers also fell into similar ranges, indicating complexity in risk assessment.

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling Results

### Linear Regression Model Performance
**Significant Variables** (p-value < 0.05):
- Events
- Total Miles  
- Truck Model

### Key Model Insights:
- **Events Impact**: +1 event = +1.55918 risk factor increase
- **Mileage Effect**: +10,000 miles = -0.1138 risk factor decrease (experience reduces risk)
- **Truck Model Effect**: Peterbilt vs Caterpillar = -0.07426 risk factor reduction
- **Multicollinearity Check**: All VIF values < 10 (no multicollinearity issues)
